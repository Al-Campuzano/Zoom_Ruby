1. Implement a simple and fast way to find all product names that match keyboard (note that we are only asking to match the product names and not other fields, such as material or description) ✓

2. Implement AND conditions, e.g. steel keyboard should match only item names which contain both steel and keyboard somewhere (not necessarily in that order) ✓

3. Implement OR conditions, e.g. steel keyboard should match item names steel table and wooden keyboard because they each contain one of our search terms

4. [stretch goal] Implement numeric range queries, e.g. steel keyboard that are priced between $40 and $70

5. [stretch goal alternative] Implement TF-IDF scoring. This could be an alternative to (4), or in addition to. This would most likely only be relevant for people already familiar with search.

6. [stretch goal alternative] Search another field, and optionally score higher if it matches more than one field.
