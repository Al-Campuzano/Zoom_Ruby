# You, a supreme being, have created a new planet and need life forms to populate this brave, new world. To accomplish this, youâ€™ll need to start with a superclass of creatures. This superclass will have the following:
 
# initialize() method
# move() method
# speak() method
# Hash of  (minimum) 3 unique items it can carry. It can hold multiple copies of the same item (i.e. 3 apples, 8 umbrellas, 11 Twinkies). 
# give_item method
# Gives x number of an item to another object.
# receive_item method
# Receives x number of an item from an object
# Can only receive an item if it already exists in the hash
# 3 attributes
