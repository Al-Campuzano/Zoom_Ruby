# Nobodyâ€™s perfect - not even supreme beings. Write the following tests:
 

# Superclass attribute is set correctly after initialization
# receive() works as expected
# give() works as expected
# The output of speak()
# 2 subclass methods
# 2 module methods
# A test that uses refute_equal
# A test that uses assert_output
# A test that uses refute_nil
# A test that uses assert_instance_of
